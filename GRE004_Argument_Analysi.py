#New appearance on the following project.


'''
The task is about analysing the argument of the essay. The
reverse task of writing an argument essay.


The following appeared in an editorial in a local newspaper.
"Commuters complain that increased rush-hour traffic on Blue
highway between the suburbs and the city center has doubled
their commuting time. The forward proposal of the motorists'
lobby is to widen the highway, adding an additional lane of
traffic."


Opponents note last year's addition of a lane to the nearby
Green Highway was followed by a worsening of traffic jams on
it. Their suggested alternative proposal is adding a bicycle
lane to Blue Highway. Many area residents are keen bicyclists.
A bicycle lane would encourage then to use bicycles to commute,
it is argued, thereby reducing rush-hour traffic.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need
to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and
the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to
explain how the answers to these questions would help to
evalute the recommendation.

Analyzing the argument

Steps on how to proceed:
1. Are the argument ever good? (Argue whether the proposed points are
well defined or not)

2. When I read the argument, what exactly am I trying to identify?
    (3 points on how to counter argue the assumptions of the writer
    in question.)

3. Once I have successfully identified the structure and parts of
argument, then find (intelligently guess) the evidences that led
the author to conclude the questions he asked?

4. Can I write now?
Once I've done the 3 things above:
    -- identify the conclusion.
    -- identify the evidence (guess the reasons behind the questions).
    -- reason out of find unstated assumptions.

Analyzing the argument:
1. Main Conclusion
2. Main Assertion
3. Main Prediction from Argument.
Opponents have proposed to add a bicycle lane to Blue Highway
rather than adopt the motorists' lobby proposal to widen the highway
with an additional lane.

1. The author is assuming that last year's issues still exist today.
2. Green Highway and Blue highway are roughly comparable.
3. The author is assuming that if you enjoy bicycle as a hobby, then
   you are likely to use that node of transportation to commute to work.
4. The author is assuming that these working locations are actually
   within biking distance.
5. The author is assuming that this added bicycle will not result in
any accidents that actually cause MORE TRAFFIC DELAYS than current set
up.

How do we go further?
We take just 3 out of the 5 above list topcis and we go further.

Start of Essay:
In this editorial from the local newspaper, it is stated that opponents of the
motorists' lobby's plan to add another land to Blue Highway have instead
advocated that a bicycle lane be constructed in order to alleviate the highway's
traffic issues. The opponents have come to this conclusion based on the issues
faced by Green Highway last year as well as the keen interest in bicycling
of the area's local residents. However, before this recommendation can be
properly evaluated, 3 questions must be answered.

First of all, are Green Highway and Blue Highway roughly comparable? In other
words, can circumstances from 1 highway be used to make generalizations and
predictions about the other? It is possible that Green Highway and Blue Highway
are not similar at all -- perhaps Green Highway runs through residential
neighbourhoods, whereas Blue Highway is located mostly in rural, unpopulated
sections of the city. Further, theres is a possibility that the quality of the
highways is markedly different, with Green Highway's roads falling apart and
Blue Highway's in pristine condition. If either of these scenarios has merit,
then conclusion drawn in the original argument is significantly weakened.

Secondly, do a majority of the area residents interested in biking live
within biking distance of their places of employment√ü The opponents in the
argument prematurely assume that many of the residents in the town will
bike to work in the morning rather than drive their cars. However this might
not be the case. Perhaps the average distance from home to work is over 15
miles, and that's why many of the residents are essentially obligated to take
the highway -- even if they don't want to. In an ideal world, they choose to
bike to work, but if the reality is such that they cannot due to the logistics
of their situations, then only one form of transportation (the car via the
highway) is possible. If the above is true, then the argument does not hold
water.

I will not write body 3.

In conclusion, the argument, as it stands now, is considerably flawed due to
its reliance on several unwarranted assumptions. If the author is able to
answer the 3 questions above and offer more evidence (perhaps in the form
of a systematic research study), then it will be possible to fully evaluate
the viability of the proposed recommendation to add a bike lane to Blue
Highway.

MAIN Takeaways:
1. When you read the argument, you need to identify the following:
   a. The main conclusion, main assertion, or main prediction
   b. The premises, the evidence, or the 'facts' that led the
   author to this conclusion.

2. With the correct identification of the conclusion and the evidence,
   you then have to do something very important. REASON THE UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS
   OUT.
   a. This is where the bulk of your writing grade for the argument essay comes
   from. Deconstruct an argument in an analytical fashion ... they are not
   necessariliy looking for your ability to write a TOEFL essay. In other words,
   they're ASKING YOU TO THINK.

3. Structures, templates, and 'one way' to write this essay are not essential.
It says so right on ETS's webiste. Howeverm we still want to have a structure
in mind because it allows us to hit ground runnning on test day. We can just
writing.

4. 3 Body paragraphs are roughly the same thing with different content.

5. Make Sure you follow the prompt's instructions. If the prompt is asking you to.
6.
