This task is about analysing the argument of the essay. The reverse task
of writing an argument essay.

The following appeared in an editorial in a local newspaper.
"Commuters complain that increased rush-hour traffic on Blue
highway between the suburbs and the city center has doubled
their commuting time. The favored proposal of the motorists'
lobby is to widen the highway, adding an additional lane of
traffic.

Opponents note last year's addition of a lane to the nearby
Green Highway was followed by a worsening of traffic jams on it.
Their suggested alternative proposal is adding a bicycle lane to
Blue Highway. Many area residents are keen bicyclists. A bicycle
lane would encourage then to use bicycles to commute, it is argued,
therevy reducing rush-hour traffic."


Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to
be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation and the
argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how
the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.


Analyzing the Argument

Steps on how to proceed:
1. Are the argument ever good?
No. These arguments are always flawed in some manner, typically because they come
they come to conclusions based on either faulty evidence or unwarranted assumptions.

2. When I read the argument, what exactly am I trying to identify?
The most important thing, the first thing, that you're trying to identify is the
author's main conclusion, main assertion, or overall prediction. This is basically
the thrust of the author's argument.

You're also trying to identify pieces of evidence and the 'facts' that the author
provides in order to support this argument.

3. Once I have successfully identified the structure and parts of the argument,
then what?

Here comes the somewhat hard part. So, you have identified the author's main
point and you have identified his or her evidence and 'facts' that led the author
to that point. But you're not finished. You need to, using that information, reason
out the assumptions (unstated) that the author relies on/might have relied based
on your evaluation to make his argument.

4- Can I write now?
Once I've done the three things above(identify the conclusion, identify the evidence,
reason out the unstated assumptions), can I write now?

Yes, you can. These essays typically follow a template, or a firm formula, and once
you have estalihed those above pieces, you should basically start writing.

Analyzing the Argument:
Main Conclusion, Main Assertion, or Main Prediction from Argument.
Opponents have proposed to add a bicycle lane to Blue Highway rather than
adopt the motorists' lobby proposal to widen the highway with an additional
lane.

What evidence does the author provide to support the conclusion of these
opponents?
1. Last year, the city widened Green Highway, but it led to a worsening of
traffic jams on it.
2. Many area residents are keen bicyclists. A bicycle lane would encourage
them to use bicycles to commute, thereby reduccing rush-hour traffic.

Analyse an Argument (unstated assumptions)
1. The author is assuming that last year's issues still exist today.
2. Green Highway and Blue Highay are roughly comparable.
3. The author is assuming that if you enjoy bicycle as a hobby, then you
are likely ot use that mode of transportation to commute to work.
4. The author is assuming that these working locations are actually within
biking distance.
5. The author is assuming that this added bicycle will not result in any
accidents that actually cause MORE traffic delays than current set up.
