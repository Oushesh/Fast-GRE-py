Introduction:
The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a journal on
environmental issues.

"Over the past year, the Crust Copper Company (CCC) has purchased
10,000 square miles of land in the tropical nation of west Fredonia.
Mining copper on this land will inevitably result in polution and,
since West Fredonia is the home of several endangered animal species,
an environmental disaster. But such disasters can be prevented if
consumers simply refuse to purhase products that are made with CCC's
copper unless the company abandons its mining plans.
"

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated
assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument
depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the
argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.


Here we start:

IN the letter to the editor, the author concludes that the environmental disasters
potentially caused by Crust Copper Company's purchase of 10,000 square miles
can be avoided if consumers simply boycott the firm's products made with
copper. However, the author supports his argument with the assumptions that,
if not substantiated, dramatically weaken the persuasiveness of the argument.

First of all, the writer presumes, without evidence, that the Crust Copper
Company will use its 10,000 acres it purchased to conduct mining operations.
However, this may not be the case. Perhaps the company acquired the land
because it wanted to present an image to the rest of the world that it
was focussed on conservation efforst. It is possible that they will engage
in preservation of the land in order to enhance its sullied reputation from
its previous, environmentally destructive operations. It is also possible
that the firm purchased the land simply as an investment and that top
excecutives have concluded the land will appreciate significantly in value.
If either of these scenarios is true, then the author's contention that
disaster can be avoided if consumers modify their purchasing behavior
does not hold water.

Second of all, the letter to the editor claims that, if Crust Copper Company
mines the land, environmental pollution will 'inevitably' result,
but this may not be necessarily true. Perhaps the author of the letter
is basing his claim off of older mining technology notorious for polluting
the environment. It is likely that mining technology has become at least
somewhat more environmentally-friendly in recent years, and it is possible
that is has become significantly less damaging to the environment. For example,
perhaps a new copper mining technique was invented that results in little
to no environmental pollution. In addition, even if mining technology has not
considerably changed, there is a potential that the company's ability to clean
up and restore the environment has drastically improved. If either case is true,
then the author's claim is not warranted and his suggestion that customers
'refuse' to purchase the corporate product is not overly persuasive.

Finally, even if it is true that Crust Corporation Company intedns to use
the land for mining and that this will result in substantial environmental
degradation, the author assumes that consumers will have the wherewithal
to determine which products contain copper acquired from the company's
mining operations. It is possible that Crust Copper Company wholesales
its copper to dozens, if not hundreds, of other retail corporations and that
its logo appears on none of the products. Or perhaps its logo
is obfuscated by other parts of the product, and consumers being unable
(or unwilling) to ascertain where every component of the product derives from.
 If it is true that the customers find it challenging to select products
 without Crust Copper Company's influence, then the author's assertion
 is invalid and his recommendation will do little to convince the company
 to forego its mining plans.

 In conclusion, it is possible that the plan for consumers to boycott the
 company products will have intended effect of forcing Crust Copper company
 to abandon its plans. However, as it stands now, the argument relies on
 three unfounded assumptions that render its conclusion unpersuasive at best
 and specious at worst. Thus, the author needs to provide additional evidence
 regarding the company's inteded use of land, the potential for pollution from
 mining, and whether consumers will be able to differentiate Crust Copper company
 products from its competitors.
