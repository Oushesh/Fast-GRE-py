Question:

The following is a letter to the editor of an environmental magazine.

'In 1975 a wildlife census found that there were 7 species of amphibians
in Xanadu National Park, with abundant numbers of each species. However,
in 2002 only 4 species of amphibians were observed. in the park, and then
numbers of each species were drastically reduced. There has been a substantial
decline in the numbers of amphibians worldwide, and global pollution of water
and air is clearly implicated. The decline of amphibians in Xanadu National
Park, however, almost certainly has a different cause: in 1975, trout --
which are known to each amphibian'

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to
evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen
the argument.

'''
Identify the assumptions and question their credibility/validity

1. The author is assuming that the observation given is correct.
2. The author is assuming that global trends apply to this specific
area.

In his letter to the editor of the environmental magazine, the author avers that,
despite the fact there is a declining trend in the number of amphibians worldwide
due to air and water contamination, the dwindling amphibian population in Xanadu
Park is a direct consequence of the introduction of trout into the park in 1975.
The author has come to this conclusion based on the fact that, according to
wildlife censuses, there has been a nearly 50% reduction in the number of
species of amphibians in the park -- and a drastic decline in the numbers of
each remaining species -- between 1975 and 2002. However, before this argument
can be properly evaluated, two specific pieces of evidence must be collected and
analyzed.

First of all, in order to determine whether the declining amphibian population
in Xanadu Park conforms to the global trend, it is necessary to evaluate the
current levels of air and water pollution in the park, and whether these levels
are detrimental to the amphibian population. While it is possible that the levels
of pollution in Xanadu Park are lower than the global average, a slight variance
in the quality of their habitat might prove deterious to certain amphibian
speices. For instance, a small variation in the levels of oxygen in the water --
due to contamination -- might prove noxious/lethal/detrimental (I would not
use this one). While it is possible that the levels of pollution in Xanadu
Park are lower than the global average, a slight variance in the quality of
their habitat might prove deterious to their lives underwater. On the other hand,
there is a possibility that the quality of air and water in Xanadu Park were
severely compromised. Xanadu Park was severely compromised between 1975 and 2002.
It may be possible that neighbouring areas experience an increase in industrial
activity within the same period of time, with industrial waste and toxic emissions
reaching the waters and air of the park, thereby drastically deteriorating the
amphibians' habitat. If either of these scenarios has merit, then the conclusion
presented in the original argument is significantly weakened.

Secondly, it is important to determine whether the 1975 wildlife census was
performed before or after the introduction of trout into the park. The author
of the letter prematurely assumes that the 1975 census does not reflect the
effect that trout has on the amphibian population. However, this might not be
the case. Perhaps the census took place several months after the introduction of
trout into the the park, with the purpose of assessing the impact of a new
predatory species -- the trout -- on amphibian population. Granted, the author
of the letter may argue that, if this were the case, the census might already
reflect a sharp reduction in the number of amphibians in Xanadu Park due to trout
foraging behavior. Still, while it is true that introducing a new predator will
reduce the number of prey, predators will only eat enough prey to sustain their
lives but they will not eat so many as to deplete their food source. If the above
is true, the extinction of nearly half the amphibian species in the park cannot
be directly attributed to trout, and thus, the argument does not hold water/(is
not valid)

In conclusion, the argument, as it stands now, is considerably flawed due to its
reliance on several unwarranted assumptions. If the author is able to provide 2
pieces of evidence stated above and perhaps conduct a systematic research study,
then it will be possible to determine whether the decline in amphibian population
in Xanadu Park is strictly a consequence of introducing trout into the park.
