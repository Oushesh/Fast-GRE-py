1.Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously
been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea
and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people.
Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean" basket in Lithos,
an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very
 deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat,
 and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean
 baskets were not uniquely Palean.

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to
evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen
the argument.

2.
On Balmer island, where mopeds serve as a popular form of transportation, the
population increases to 100,00 during the summer months. To reduce the
number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians, the town council of
Balmer Island should limit the number of mopeds rented by the island's
moped rental companies from 50/day to 25/day during the summer season. By
limiting the number of rentals, the town council will attain the 50 percent
annual in moped accidents that was achieved last year on the neighboring
island of Seaville, when Seaville's town council enforced similar limits
on moped rentals.

3. Arctic deer live on islands in Canada's arctic regions. They search for
food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of the year.
Their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which
they feed and cold enough, at least some of the year, for the ice to cover
the sea separating the islands, allowing the deer to travel over it.
Unfortunately, according to reports from local hunters, the deer populations
are declining. Since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends
that have caused the sea ice to melt, we can conclude that the purported decline
in deer populations is the result of the deer's being unable to follow their
age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea.

Definitely agree.
Give 2--3 points for Definitely agree.

But before that:

4. We recommend that Monarch Books open a cafe in its store. Monarch, having
been in business at the same location for more than 20 years, has a large customer
base because it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects. Clearly,
opening the cafe would attract more customers. Space could be made for the cafe
by discontinuing the children's book section, which will probably become less
popular given that the most recent national census indicated a significant decline
in the percentage of the population under age ten. Opening a cafe will allow
MOnarch to attract more customers and better compete with Regal Books, which
recently opened its own cafe.

5. Nature's Way, a chain of stores selling health food and other health-related
products, is opening its next franchise in the town of Plainsville. The store
should prove to be very successful: Nature's way franchises tend to be most
profitable in areas where residents lead healthy lives, and clearly Plainsville
in such an area. Plainsville merchants report that sales of runnign shoes and
exercise clothing are all-time highs- The local health club has more members
than ever, and the weight training and aerobics classes are always full. Finally,
Plainsville's schoolchildren represent a new generation of potential customers:
these schoolchildren are required to participate in a fitness-fo-life program,
which emphasizes the benefits of regular exercise at an early age.
