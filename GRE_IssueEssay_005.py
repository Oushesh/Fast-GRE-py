I mostly agree with the statement in the prompt.

IN some cases and in some fileds, the more knowledge one acquires, the simpler
and easier things become. Take American football, for instance. When an outside
observer attends a game, the rules and procedures appear to be complex and it
is not uncommon for this observer to have essentially no idea of what is occurring
before her eyes. Howerver, as exposure to the game increases, its rules become
less arcane(blurry or fuzzy), the players actions lees mysterious, and the coach's
decision less ambiguous, and, before the woman realizes it, she, for the most
part, has a firm grasp on the game. This phenomenon is not confined to the world
of sports, however. It is also present in some academic fields, particularly
medicine.
