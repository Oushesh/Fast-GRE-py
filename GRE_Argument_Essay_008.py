Mission Statment:
The following recommendation was made by the president and administrative staff
of Grove College, a private insititution, to the college's governing committee.

We reommend that Grove College preserve its century-old tradition of all-female
education rather than admit men into its programs. It is true that a majority of
faculty members voted in favor of coeducation, arguing that it would encourage
more students to apply to Grove. But 80% of the students responding to a survey
conducted by the student government wanted the school to remain all female, and
over half of the alumnae who answered a separate survey also opposed coeducation.
Keeping the college all female will improve morale among students and convince
alumnae to keep supporting the college financially.


Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered
in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted
result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to
evaluate the recommendation.

In the memo, the president of Grove college concludes that the school should
retain all-female student body because it will enhance morale and persuade
alumnae to continuing their financial support of the industry. However, while
the conclusion drawn by the president might hold water, it rests on several
unfounded assumptions that, if not substantiated, dramatically weaken the
persuasiveness of the argument. Thus, the following 3 questions might be
addressed.

First, was the survey of the student body coducted scientifically? It is
possible that the survey was completed with a non-representative sample of the
student body. Perhaps the survey organizers only asked students in a feminine
empowerment class, thus skewing the results to the all-female body opinion. It
is also possible that the survey was conducted online and only the most ardent
supporters of an all-female student body took the time to fill it out. If either
of these scenarios proves true, then the assertion of the president is
significantly hampered.

Second, do the alumnae who voted in the survey regarding coeducation contribute
significant funds to the university? There is the potential that those alumnae
who responded are the ones who least contribute to Grove College. Perhaps
most of the funds from alumnae derive from a very select few wealthy individuals
who donate millions of dollars each year, and the vast majority of graduates
of Grove College do not provide any funding to the school. If this is the case,
the the president should instead conduct a survey a survey of those who donate
the most funds to the school, not the alumnae in general. Doing so would substantially
increase the credibility of the argument.

Finally, if the school remains all-female, will some of the faculty in favor of
coeducation beomce disllusioned with the university and look for other jobs? It
is possible that the current stock of professors will begin to look for other
employment opportunities at other universities if policy is not changed. If this
occurs, the school might lose many of its most qualified professors, suffer in
the rankings, have fewer students apply, and thus be considerably hurt in terms
of both reputation and funding (the majority of which comes from tuition fees).
If it is true that the professors feel passionately about this topic, then
ignoring their majority vote might not be in the best interests of the university
and the contention from the president could actually do more damage to the
institution.

In conclusion, while the president may have come to a sound conclusion regarding
the make-up of the student body, more data is needed before a firm conlusion
is reached. If the president answers the aboce 3 questions, it will be possible
to fully evaluate the validity of the argument.
