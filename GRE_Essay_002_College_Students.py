ARGUMENT ESSAY
Essay students Problem:

College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects
that interest them rather than the courses that seem most
likely to lead to jobs.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree
or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for
the position you take. In developing and supporting your position,
describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation
would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples
shape your position.

Structure type they want:
Hook (genralisation, anectode, interesting fact, trend, quote, etc..)
    --> Introduces the topic (nothing more); don't write your thesis or
    supporting ideas!
Shift to Prompt
    --> Makes your essay more cohesive; an abrupt shift to your thesis
    is awkward.
Thesis (most important part of the essay, by far)
    --> This baby is the boss and controls everything.
Outline (Tell your reader how you're going to structure your essay)
    --> Doesn't have to overly detailed.

PROMPT
(The choice of one's college is not a trivial one. In fact, it is not
uncommon for entering/newcoming students to ruminate(unsurely deciding)
on this decision for months, perhaps years, and then, once a decision has
been made, immediately begin to second guess it.)

SHIFT TO PROMPT

(The prompt recommends that students not belabor this point too long and simply
choose a path that conforms most closely to their interests and skills.)

THESIS
(In my opinion, I strongly agree with this suggestion and argue that students look
inward rather than outward when choosing college courses for TWO REASONS.)

TOPIC SENTENCE WHICH INTRODUCES THE IDEA
(To begin, the job market is ever shifting, and one decade's 'hot' job is
another decade's dying one. Thus, to choose one's profession based soley
on the availability of work to take a short-term perspective, one that
will likely backfire.)

EXAMPLE
(For instance, in the 1950s through the 1980s, nuclear
engineering was a rapidly growing field as many of the most powerful nations
were not only designing and manufacturing nuclear weapons, but hundreds of
nuclear power plants as well. Consequently, nuclear engineering gradutates
were able to find high-paying work almost immediately upon graduation. However,
because of issues related to NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) and recent
nuclear accidents like the well-publicized Fukushima disaster, many countries
are moving away from nuclear power in favor of green technologies. Students
who chose nuclear engineering in the 1970s because of the 'abundant' job
prospects were certainly facing a job market in the 1990s -- and this market
has only worsened through the 2000s.)

DEVELOPMENT/EXPLANATION
(The above example illustrates that the job market is highly contingent upon
upredictable factors and that, if one
assumes it is static, he or she is likely to get burned at some point in the
future. It seems abusrd to think of now during the technological boom, but
will the software engineering industry still possess dizzying jobs prospects
in the future? History tell us that it will not.)

Further, even if we assume that the job market is not dynamic that it is
as unchanging as gravity, one should still pursue  his/her interests because
our happinnes level plays a crucial role in how effectively we work. For
instance, if a student who is passionate about horse training 'pragmatically'
chooses the path of computer programming because of the plethora of lucrative
job opportunities, she runs the risk of finding herself in a field she abhors(hates)
and a job she finds no satisfaction in. She might go to work each day,sit at her
desk, and stare at her computer screen with the horse wallpaper, wondering what
could have been and the career path she could have chosen. She might complete
her programming tasks haphazardly and submit subpar work. Research has consistently
demonstrated that, perhaps above all other factors, happiness has the most direct
causal effect on work efficiency. In other words, workers who find personal
satisfaction in their craft not only work faster, but produce higher quality
products and services as well. Thus, on a macro scale, goverments should encourage
their populations to pursue their populations to pursue their passions because,
long-term, doing so leads to a more smoothly functioning economy not bogged down
by worker discontentment. One needs to only look at government regimes from the
past that forced many of their citizens to work on farms for the 'collective
good'. The vast majority of these worers had no interest on the farm, and agricultural
output plummeted as a result. This phenomenon can infect an entire ecnonomy if
people choose fields of study based soley on the promise of work and income.


CONCLUSION/STRONG THESIS
(Of course, some argue that in our increasingly globalized economy competition for
jobs has skyrocketed and thus it is imperative that we pursue practical paths.)

COUNTERPOINT-- Shut down counterpoint and explain how it doesn't apply and doesn't
hold water.
(However, isn't that precisely why we should follow our interests? If we do so,
we're likely to do the best job possible. We're likely to compete at the highest
level. We're likely to carve out a niche for ourselves in this 'increasingly
globalized world.')

REPHRASE THESIS AND WRAP IT UP!!!
(People who ignore their inner voices do so at their own peril.)
